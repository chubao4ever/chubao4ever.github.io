This is the first post of our blog site. First I would like to say thank you for reading!

Our posts would vary from different kinds of topics, e.g. programming language/platform like iOS, Android, Python, Django..., startup news, gadgets, sports, pets and stories/thoughts of our team members, but they would mainly focus on technology side.

A couple of months ago, we have setup our team goal, which is "Making the world a better place" [^1]. We believe **blogging** is one of the ways to achieve the goal.

[^1]: this idea came from HBO's [Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps) LOL
