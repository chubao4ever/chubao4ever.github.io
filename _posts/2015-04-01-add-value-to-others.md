```
TRY NOT TO BECOME A MAN OF SUCESS, BUT RATHER TRY TO BECOME A MAN OF VALUE

- ALBERT EINSTEIN
```

Most of the people pretend to serves their own interests without adding any value to others.It is not a good phenomenon because success would not come if you never give a hand to others.

Someone said if you help enough people get what they want, you will get what you want. It is the primary strategy to market yourself.

## How can we add value to others?

1. Give people what they want

        It is difficult for you to find out what people want as they do not know
        what they actually want until they see it...

        Therefore, you need to figure it out in different methods, such as going
        out to see what people interest in, checking what is the hot topics in
        forums and etc... Then, you could write article in that direction.

2. Give away 90% of what you do for free

        It is the most effective way to promote yourself. You might think it is
        dummy thing and wasting time but it is a kind of investment. It could
        create more opportunities and increase your reputation. As a result, you
        might get a better and higher-paying job, more client or launch a product.

3. The fast track to success

        Helping people to solve their problem is the best method to show `you are
        worthy`. Nobody would think you are great if you never show your strength.

4. Offering more of yourself

        The more you help others, the more you gain. After you solved many bugs,
        you could easily solve your own problem. Also, if you need some helps,
        many people would give you a hand.
