In 2015, our team comes a new programmer, which is also our company's first female Hong Kong software engineer. After I become a team lead, I need to do lots of hands-on training on her. Meanwhile, I came across Joost's article ["What most young programmers need to learn"](http://joostdevblog.blogspot.hk/2015/01/what-most-young-programmers-need-to.html) and aroused my sympathy.

I would summarize the article below:

- most of the time spending on supervising is NOT on explaining advanced technologies or the details of engine, but on making them write better code in general
- code should be clear, understandable and maintainable
- achieve the above requires self discipline, because it means not stopping "when it works"
    - always write the clearest code you can
    - refactor code if it becomes muddy through changes later in development
    - remove unused code and add comments
(I strongly agree with this. This reminds me of the first couple of years of my IT career, which needs to be strictly disciplined.)
