This is a software engineering team's blog site of a HK-based startup called [MotherApp](http://motherapp.com/). Chu Bao (Traditional Chinese: 豬包) is the name of our team.

We named Chu Bao after one of our teammate's [blood parrot cichlid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_parrot_cichlid). Chu Bao is a cute and naughty fish, but unfortunately Chu Bao left us in July last year 2014. We have no intention to rename as the spirit of Chu Bao is still with us.

Chu Bao is a young  and energetic team consists of 4 software engineers: David Cheung, Keith Chan, Lawrence Liu and Milk Wong.
